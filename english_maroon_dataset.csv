ON Monday the 14th of February, eloped from the Subscriber
a negro wench named ROSINE, Congo born, 21 or 22 years of
age, speaks French and English, tall and slender ; she had on
when she went off a gingham petticoat tied high on her body,
and a flannel wrapper. The goods she took away were laid on
a small cherry board, and she had on her arm a small basket,
in which there ought to have been a bundle of India handkerchiefs,
a bundle of plain stockings, and about four dozen of
tape, she ought also to have a blanket capot, if she has not sold
it. A Spaniard came to the subscriber on the 11th instant, and
declared that he tried to apprehend said negro wench at la Terre
aux Boeufs, but that two Americans opposed him because he
could not show any order from her master, and said that if the
subscriber would give him one, he would take upon himself to
bring her back, and to prevent all difficulties on this head, the
subscriber not only gave him that power, but went to the Mayor
with him to get an order from him in the English language, to
seize said negro wench. That Spaniard declared his name was
JEAN MARTINE, formerly a gardener for Mrs. Montreuil,
where on enquiry he was employed for eight or ten days to
that capacity. That Spaniard in fact, apprehended said negro
wench, and slept on the night of Sunday at Mr. Lassise’s, at the
Terre aux Boeufs, and he received the money arising from the
sale of the goods entrusted to with the wench, which amouted
to forty five dollars sixty-eight cents and three quarters, which
appears from the inventory drawn by Mr. Lassise, and he went
away with the wench on Monday morning to town, since when
the subscriber has not heard of him. There is occasion for the
Subscriber to suspect that said Spaniard has abused the confidence
placed in him, for he said to several persons at la Terre
aux Boeufs, that he was a partner with Mr. Moreau, to whom
said wench formerly belonged, and he said that he had a great
deal of goods there and along the coast.
Captains of vessels are hereby requested not to give a passage
to said Spaniard or the wench, or they will be prosecuted
according to the law made and provided in such cases. The
description of the Spaniard, Jean Martine, is as follows : he is
5 feet 2 inches high, thin, brown visage, and though about fifty
years of age, very active ; he had a blanket capot, very tight on
his body.

speaks a little French—he has very short hair which begins

superior eye tooth, and has a small brown spot on the white
of his left eye.—he has on both cheeks the same stamp which
Auguste has on the breast.—He is acquainted with the fabrication
of powder, distilling and making soap.

says, to a whitlow; she was marked SS, heart between, high
on both shoulders, but it is likely that the marks are worn out

well known among the negroes on that estate, having formerly
nursed a child of the family of the Goulburn’s; she has also
been seen often at a Mrs. Goulburn’s, near Milk-River, and

carrying with them their two very fair Children, JUSTINA,
(commonly called JESSE) and HENRY. Fanny is a tall, goodlooking,
stout made woman, with black hair and high cheek
bones, and is believed to have a scar somewhere on her forehead.
She is about four months gone in pregnancy. Betsey is a
rather short, stout made, lively woman, very fond of dress. Justina
and Henry are very fine children. Justina (Fanny’s child)
is two years and three months old, and has several marks on
her body. Henry (Betsey’s child) is about three years old. Both
the women are about 20 years of age and uncommonly smart.
They have carried with them a number of cloths. Fanny can
write a little, and they may perhaps attempt to forge a pass ; but the probability is, that they are under the protection of some
white man, who has inveigled them away. They are suspected
to be accompanied by a very tall Black Woman, sometimes
called Nancy, and sometimes Mary. Nancy has a scar upon
her breast, about the size of a quarter of a dollar, which is said
to have been occasioned by a burn. Nancy’s husband Isaac,
or Henry, is thought also to be with them. He is a rather short
Black Man. All of these will probably change their names.
Betsey and Fanny are well known in Charleston. Betsey is the
property of Dr. Joseph Kirkland, and Fanny of McMillan Campbell.
Nancy and her husband are believed to be old runaways.

ever committed, if they return to their owners of their own accord,
they shall be forgiven. A Reward of One Hundred Dollars
will be given for lodging them safely in any Gaol of this State

CHARLES ; he is about five feet ten inches high, very ugly,
has a broad flat nose and a very large mouth, but is very sensible

was not paid. Some persons knowing that the above slaves had
been previously mortgaged to Mr. Pratt, and from him passed
to some of her hands, warned me to look sharp. This notice
being given me, I desired the mulatto girl to stay in my house
until the money advanced was paid, being fearful of their
migration, notwithstanding this, the wench ranaway from my

RANAWAY the following slaves, on Monday last: - ORANGE,
a yellow skinned woman, has her left foot a little swelled,
she was some time back harboured by a person called mr.
Thomas, living on the road leading to St. John’s, at the yard
of a free woman called Bella. Also, some time back, NELLY
FRENCH, an elderly woman, but looks young, she is short,
with good looking features, has a husband named Johnny Bolt,
a free sambo man, a tailor, who lives at one John Mendes’ a
free brown man’s mountain, near Barry’s estate, in St. John’s,
she has been often seen on the road therefrom. PATTY, her daughter,
a stout able wench, looks sulky, with a pug-nose. Also
JUDY, her daughter, about twenty years of age, a stout wench;
the said Judy was met near Trower’s pen, going to her mother
Patty, who is harboured at mrs. Adolphus’ red hill by a negro
named Charles, who, it is understood, is determined to lose his
head before Patty shall be taken from him, for which purpose
he has built a house in the middle of the woods at the said
mountain, where other runaways are harboured. THETFORD,
a daring and outrageous fellow, about twenty years of age,
likely features, and coal black; he was harboured some time
back by his uncle, William, a yellow skinned negro, belonging
to mr. William Witter, at Mount Pelier – it is lately understood
he is harboured by him again. PRUE, an elderly woman, short
and stout: she is harboured at the late Bessy Wheeler’s red
hill, just above Blackwood’s mountain, by a disfigured negro, named James. From the strange manner these negroes have
absconded, it is evident that they have been enticed away by
the said Nelly French, she having great influence over them.
The following reward will be paid for apprehending the above
runaways: One Doubloon each for Patty and Thetford; and a
Pistole each for yhe remaining ones; and Ten Pounds each on
proving to conviction by whom harboured.

On Tuesday the 6th inst. a negro wench named RACHEL, about 45 or 50 years old, was formerly an oyster wench and fisher, both which employments she is fond of; speaks German, and has lost the large toe from one foot. She is very plausible, and may try to pass for free--has taken three suits of clothes, one old dark drab Wrapper and Coat, one ditto blue homespun, and one entire new suit of homespun stripe. It is conjectured that she will endeavor to get into the country by some of the Boats, to her brother, about Grandy or Columbia. Whoever will ap- prehend the said Wench and deliver her to the subscriber, or to the Master of the Work-House, shall be entitled to a suitable reward.

Ran away from their owners, on the evening of Wednesday, the 17th inst.

Fanny is a tall (good-looking, stout made wo- man) woman, stout made, (with) black hair (pas de ,-> black hair and high), high cheek bones(,) and is believed to have a scar some where on her forehead. (She is about four months gone in pregnancy) Betsey is a rather short, stout made, lively woman (,very fond of dress). (directement Justina and Henry) They are both about 20 years of age. Justina and Henry are very fine children. Justina (, Fanny’s child,) is two years and three months (old, and has several marks on her body.), (pas de and ->) and Henry (,Betsey’s child, is about) three years old. Both the women are (about 20 years of age, and)uncommonly smart.(.--) They have carried with them a number of clothes. Fanny can write a little, and they may probably (perhaps at- tempt to) forge a pass; but the probability is, that they are un- der the protection of some white man, who has inveigled them away. (They are suspected to be accompanied by a very tall black Woman, sometimes called Nancy, and sometimes Mary. Nancy has a scar upon her breast, about the size of a quarter dollar, which is said to have been occasioned by a burn. Nan- cy’s husband, Isaac, or Henry, is thought also to be with them. He is a rather short black Man. All of these will probably chan- ge their names. Betsey and Fanny are well known in Charles- ton. Betsey is the property of Dr. Joseph Kirkland, and Fanny of McMillan Campbell. Nancy and he husband are believed to be old runaways. As this is the first fault of the kind that Betsey and Fanny have ever committed, if they return to their owners of their own accord, they shall be forgiven.
